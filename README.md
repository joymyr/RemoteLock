# Remote Lock

Update: I made another project to support the newest lock version: https://github.com/joymyr/secuyou_remote

Update: Support lock/unlock over MQTT, see how to configure in Futurehome: https://forum.futurehome.io/t/virtuell-dorlas/2546/3

Based on [Android-nRF-Toolbox](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Toolbox)
Modified to remote control Secuyou Bluetooth locks over PushBullet, using a spare Android phone or a Raspberry PI
Tested on lock that works with the app "Secuyou Lock app". 
Might need some adjustments if your locks use the "Secuyou Smart Lock" app, like the ids defined in no/nordicsemi/android/nrftoolbox/proximity/ProximityManager.java

* Create a free Pushbullet account. Go to "My Account" and create an access token
* Add configuretion to local.properties:
  ```
  pushbulletKey="<your key>"
  mqttUri="tcp://xxx.xxx.x.xxx:1884"
  mqttUsername="<mqtt username>"
  mqttPassword="<mqtt password>"
  mqttLockCmdTopic="<Topic for recieving the door lock command>"
  mqttLockEvtTopic="<Topic for sending door lock events>"
  mqttAlarmEvtTopic="<Topic for sending door lock errors and messages>"
  ```
* Install Android on a Raspberry PI or find a spare Android phone that you can leave within reach of your lock, and always connected to power
* Pair the device with your Secuyou lock from bluetooth settings
* Run this app on the PI/phone
* Add the device within the app
* Modify app\src\main\java\no\nordicsemi\android\nrftoolbox\remote\*.kt if needed. This is where the remote communication happens.

To make a request from another system using pushbullet:
* Call url: "https://api.pushbullet.com/v2/ephemerals"
* Headers:
  * "Access-Token": "Your access token"
  * "Content-Type": "application/json"
* Body
  * "{\"push\":{\"doorlock\":\"unlock\"},\"type\":\"push\"}" (to unlock the door)
  * "{\"doorlock\":\"lock\"},\"type\":\"push\"}" (to lock the door)
I have successfully used this with the Android-app "HTTP Request shortcuts".


To integrate with another system using MQTT (Tested with Futurehome):
* Post to topic:
```
{
  "serv": "door_lock",
  "type": "cmd.lock.set",
  "val_t": "bool",
  "val": <true or false>,
  "src": "<anything other than lock>"
}
```
* Handle MQTT messages sent to event topic in this format:
```
{
    "serv": "door_lock",
    "type": "evt.lock.report",
    "val_t": "bool_map",
    "val": {
        "door_is_closed": true,
        "is_secured": <true or false>
    },
    "src": "lock"
}
```
* Optionally handle MQTT messages sent to alarm event topic in this format:
```
{
    "serv": "alarm_lock",
    "type": "evt.alarm.report",
    "val_t": "str_map",
    "val": {
        "event": "<message>",
        "status": "activ"
    },
    "src": "lock"
}
```
